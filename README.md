# ETL_Pipeline_Project
We have a data set containing real messages that were sent during disaster events. We will create a machine learning pipeline to categorize these events so that we can send the messages to an appropriate disaster relief agency.  This project includes a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app also displays visualizations of the data.
